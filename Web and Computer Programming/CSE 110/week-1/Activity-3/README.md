# **ASSIGNMENT:  Activity 3 - ID Badge Generator**

PURPOSE:  To write a program that asks a user for their favorite color, then allow them to type in their color. Finally, have the program respond to them by displaying the text "Your favorite color is" followed by the color they typed.

## Overview

An ID badge, such as a drivers license or student ID, contains personal details that are formatted in a very specific way.

For this activity you will write a program that will create a properly formatted ID badge.

## Assignment

Write a program to prompt the user for the following:

- `First name, Last name, Email Address, Phone Number, Job Title, ID Number`

Then you should display the information back in this format:

Note that the square brackets [] indicate a value coming from the user and should not be displayed.

`[LAST NAME], [first name]`

`[Job title]`

`ID: [id number]`

`[email address]`

`[phone number]`

---

In addition to the spacing and punctuation shown above, you must implement the following requirements:

- The last name should be converted from whatever the user types to be displayed in ALL CAPS.
- The job title should be displayed so that the first letter is capitalized.
- The email address should be displayed in all lowercase.

An example of the program running is shown:

`Please enter the following information:`

`First name: Jane`

`Last name: Doe`

`Email address: JaneDoe@email.com`

`Phone number: (208) 555-1234`

`Job title: Chief Software Architect`

`ID Number: 83-23821`

---



`The ID Card is:`

`----------------------------------------------`

DOE, Jane

Chief Software Architect

ID: 83-23821

(208) 555-1234
