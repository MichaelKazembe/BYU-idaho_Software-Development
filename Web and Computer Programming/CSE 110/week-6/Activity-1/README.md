# Activity Instructions

#### Overview

Practice opening files and reading text from them.

#### Instructions

For this assignment, you'll download the file [books.txt](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse110-ww-course/week06/books.txt) that contains the names of the books in the Book of Mormon, and save it to your computer.

Once you have the file saved to your computer, in VS Code, open the *folder* that contains it and create a new Python script.

Have your program open the file, read through it line by line, strip off leading and trailing whitespace and display each book to the screen.

The following shows the expected output:

```plaintext

1 Nephi
2 Nephi
Jacob
Enos
Jarom
Omni
Words of Mormon
Mosiah
Alma
Helaman
3 Nephi
4 Nephi
Mormon
Ether
Moroni
```
