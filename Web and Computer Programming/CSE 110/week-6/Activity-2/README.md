# Activity Instructions

#### Overview

Practice finding elements in a list.

#### Instructions

To simplify your program to focus on the task at hand, instead of reading from a file, please copy and paste the following list of people and their ages into your program:

```python

people = [
    "Stephanie 36",
    "John 29",
    "Emily 24",
    "Gretchen 54",
    "Noah 12",
    "Penelope 32",
    "Michael 2",
    "Jacob 10"
]
```

Write a program to find the youngest person in the list.

Consider following these steps to build up to the finished program:

1. Iterate through the list and display each string to the screen.
2. Split the string into a name and age and print them to the screen.
3. Find the age that is the youngest.
4. Keep track of the name of the person that is the youngest.
