# Activity Instructions

Practice solving problems with variables and expressions, and displaying the results.

# The Problem: Converting between different types of units

Temperature, like many other values, can be measured in different kinds of units. In this case, you might measure the value of degrees in Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin. Converting from one scale to another uses the same calculation over and over again for different input values.

Situations like this one are the perfect case for a program that can be coded to complete the steps of the calculation.

# Assignment

Write a program to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Display the result to one decimal place of precision.

To convert degrees in Fahrenheit to Celsius you need to subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit amount and then multiply it by the fraction 5/9.

Here is an example of the program when it runs:

```plaintext

What is the temperature in Fahrenheit? 81
The temperature in Celsius is 27.2 degrees.
```

Another example is:

```plaintext

What is the temperature in Fahrenheit? 12
The temperature in Celsius is -11.1 degrees.
```
