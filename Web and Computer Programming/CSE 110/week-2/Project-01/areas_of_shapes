# For the Stretch Challenge,
# I will prompt the user to enter the length of the square, the length and width of the rectangle, and the radius of the circle. 
# I will then compute the area of each shape in square centimeters and square meters.

# AREA OF CIRCLE

# Prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle.
