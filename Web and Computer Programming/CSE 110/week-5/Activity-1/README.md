# Activity Instructions

### Overview

Practice creating lists, adding to them, and iterating through them.

#### Instructions

Ask the user for the names of their friends and append them to a list. Then, display each of the friends in the list. You should stop asking for friends when the user types "end".

Hint 1: You should keep asking for friends, as long as the name is not "end". (Does this sound like a loop you know?)

Hint 2: Be careful not to add "end" to the list of names when it is typed. You can check if the name is or is not something before you add it to the list.

The following examples show the expected output:

```plaintext

Type the name of a friend: Matthew
Type the name of a friend: Mark
Type the name of a friend: Luke
Type the name of a friend: John
Type the name of a friend: end

Your friends are:
Matthew
Mark
Luke
John
```

Another example could be the following:

```plaintext

Type the name of a friend: Peter
Type the name of a friend: James
Type the name of a friend: John
Type the name of a friend: end

Your friends are:
Peter
James
John
```
